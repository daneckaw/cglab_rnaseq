# GO

Gene Ontology analysis results for both within strain and between strain comparisons.

Files generated using candidagenome.org, CGD Gene Ontology Term Finder or CGD Gene Ontology Slim Mapper, focusing on Biological Process.
In both cases we used default values on the website.

Each GO results file is generated from the file in data/deseq2 with the corresponding file stem, e.g. BothStrains_Drug_vs_DMSO_down_GOslim.txt is generated from BothStrains_Drug_vs_DMSO_down2x_FDR5_names.txt
