featureCounts

23 May 2024

Read counts per gene generated by featureCounts.
Generated by a Nextflow pre-processing pipeline.

Raw counts and reads per million (rpm) for each strain across all conditions are collected in the tab-delimited text format files:
- featureCounts/Candida_glabrata_BG2/BG2_all_conditions_featureCounts.tab- featureCounts/Candida_glabrata_BG2/BG2_all_conditions_rpm.tab
- featureCounts/Candida_glabrata_CBS138/CBS138_all_conditions_featureCounts.tab
- featureCounts/Candida_glabrata_CBS138/CBS138_all_conditions_rpm.tab
